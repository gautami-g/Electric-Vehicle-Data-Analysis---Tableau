## Key Business Insights:
**1. EV Growth Trend:**
The number of registered EVs has significantly increased from 796 in 2011 to 37,079 in 2023.
A sharp increase is observed from 2017 onwards, with the highest surge in 2022 (27,799 EVs) and 2023 (37,079 EVs).
This suggests a strong market shift toward EV adoption in recent years.

**2. Top EV Brands:**
Tesla dominates the market with 68,943 registered vehicles, followed by:
Nissan (13,497 EVs)
Chevrolet (12,025 EVs)
Ford (7,601 EVs)
BMW, Kia, Toyota, and Volkswagen are also key players.

**3. Average Electric Range Over Time:**
The average range of EVs has improved significantly:
2011: ~70 miles
2015: ~98 miles
2018: 156 miles
2020: 240 miles
However, data from 2021 onwards shows a sharp decline, possibly due to an increase in plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) with lower battery ranges.

**4. Popular EV Models:**
The Tesla Model Y (28,502 EVs) and Model 3 (27,709 EVs) are the most popular choices.
Other notable models:
Nissan Leaf (13,187 EVs)
Tesla Model S (7,611 EVs)
Chevy Bolt EV (5,733 EVs)
Tesla Model X, Chevy Volt, VW ID.4, and Kia Niro are also widely used.


## Business Implications:
✅ Market Expansion: The EV industry is experiencing rapid growth, particularly after 2017. Companies should invest in charging infrastructure and battery technology.

✅ Tesla Dominance: Tesla holds a strong market share, but competition from Nissan, Chevrolet, and Ford is growing. New entrants need differentiation strategies.

✅ Range Improvement: Battery technology improvements are crucial, as consumers prefer longer-range EVs.

✅ Shifting Preferences: The decline in average range in recent years may indicate a shift towards PHEVs or more affordable short-range EVs.
